FedNoel: Federated Noisy Embedding Learning for Robust Federated Learning in Human Activity Recognition

---

## FedDSHAR Overview
FedNoel is a federated learning framework designed for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) under noisy or mislabeled client data. Unlike existing approaches that discard unreliable clients or filter noisy samples, FedNoel explicitly exploits noisy labels as information to improve robustness and generalization.
